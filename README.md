## Implementing Deep Learning Algorithm Self Organizing Map : Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on the Data-Set of Google Stock Prices
The popularity of stock market trading is growing rapidly, which is encouraging researchers to find out new methods for the prediction using new techniques. The forecasting technique is not only helping the researchers but it also helps investors and any person dealing with the stock market. In order to help predict the stock indices, a forecasting model with good accuracy is required. In this work, we have used one of the most precise forecasting technology using Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory unit which helps investors, analysts or any person interested in investing in the stock market by providing them a good knowledge of the future situation of the stock market
